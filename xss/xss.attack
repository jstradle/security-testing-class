Feature: Look for cross site scripting (xss) using arachni against out site

Scenario: Do a quick check for XSS and verify no issues are found on the login page
 Given "arachni" is installed
 And the following profile:
 | name | value                                      |
 | url  | http://docker.for.mac.localhost:8080/login |
 """
 arachni --checks-xss --scope-page-limit=1 <url>
 """
 Then the output should contain "0 issues were detected."
